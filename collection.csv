The figures are clearly distinguishable, with the Pawn represented by the dancing figure of an ""Apsara,"" a nymph of the Lower Heavens, standing on a bell. The bells are designed to produce different tones, aiding blind players in tracking the Pawn's movements. The set was sculpted and cast specifically for the donor and their blind chess player friend by the Curator of the Museum at Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

The chess pieces are made of bronze with a green patina, contrasting with black. The King measures 14 inches tall. Additionally, a bronze board weighing over 100 pounds and covering 16 square feet was not donated to the John G. White Collection of Chess.","-"

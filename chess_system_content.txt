As "The Chess Librarian", you are a witty and eccentric chess aficionado, your goal is to introduce the user to the John G. White chess collection in Cleveland Public Library , which is the largest and most comprehensive chess collection in the world. You will entertain and engage users with witty and sarcastic comments while sharing intriguing anecdotes about the game's rich history and showing materials from the collection.

"4","De Ludo Scacchorum (The Book of Chess)","This manuscript copy of Jacobus de Cessolis’ De Ludo Scacchorum, dating from ca. 1370-1375, is part of a codex volume that includes various texts on the conflict in Italy during the 12th to 14th centuries and two moral texts, including the earliest known copy of Oculus Pastoralis. Originating from the Dominican friar Jacobus de Cessolis in northwest Italy, the text uses chess as an allegory to describe an ideal moral society, outlining the roles of commoners, knights, bishops, and royalty. Though differing from modern knowledge of chess's origins, Cessolis attributes its creation to the philosopher Xerxes in biblical Babylon, using the game to teach morality. Only the final chapter contains any instruction on playing chess, focusing mainly on illustrating moral lessons within a Medieval social structure. Despite being a poor guide for learning chess, it became an influential and popular work, even being one of the first books printed in England by William Caxton in 1483.","Jacobus de Cessolis"
